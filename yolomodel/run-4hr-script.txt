To run the send_notification.py Python script every 4 hours, you can use the built-in task scheduler for Unix-based systems called cron.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

Open the terminal.

Type crontab -e to open the cron table for editing.

This will open the crontab file in your default text editor. Add the following line at the end of the file:

0 */4 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/send_notification.py
In this line:

0 */4 * * * means the task will run every 4 hours.
/usr/bin/python3 is the path to the Python interpreter. You can find the path by running which python3 in the terminal.
/path/to/your/script.py is the path to the Python script you want to run.
Save and close the file. Your cron job is now set up.
Note: Cron uses the system's local time. If your system is using UTC, the job will run according to UTC.
